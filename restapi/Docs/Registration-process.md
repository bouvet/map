# Registration Process

The first thing the user will do is entering their email. A request is then sent to the backend creating an Email entity with a confirmation code.
The user will then receive an email from the system with the confirmation code. They will then have to enter that code to confirm their email.

Once all digits are entered a new request will be sent to the server confirming the code. User email will then be confirmed and the user can proceed with entering their
name, date of birth and password.
